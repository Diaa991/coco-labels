# Common Objects in Context (COCO) Labels

The labels are divided into three sections:

1. Original COCO paper
2. COCO dataset release in 2014
3. COCO dataset release in 2017

Since the labels for COCO datasets released in 2014 and 2017 were the same, they were merged into a single file.
The file name should be self-explanatory in determining the publication type of the labels.
